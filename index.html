    <h2>🔍 Introduction</h2>
    <p>Douyin is the Chinese version of TikTok, and has evolved from an entertainment app into a major e-commerce platform. It integrates short videos, live-streaming, and AI-powered recommendations to drive consumer engagement. Businesses use it to promote products through interactive and immersive experiences, allowing users to shop directly from content they enjoy.</p>
    <p>This fusion of content and commerce has reshaped the retail landscape in China. Especially during 2024, Douyin has become one of the most influential digital marketing tools, playing a critical role in the success of influencer-led sales campaigns and product launches.</p>

    <h2>✅ Advantages & ❌ Disadvantages</h2>
    <div class="points-grid">
      <div class="pro">
        <h3>💡 Personalized AI Content</h3>
        <p>Boosts exposure, targets specific audiences, and improves ROI. AI tailors recommendations per user, increasing relevance and conversion rates. The algorithm ensures viewers see products aligned with their interests.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="con">
        <h3>⚠️ Limited Discovery</h3>
        <p>Can narrow product diversity and create excessive consumption cycles. Users may be trapped in a content loop, repeatedly exposed to similar products, reducing discovery of new or diverse items.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pro">
        <h3>🎥 Seamless Livestream Shopping</h3>
        <p>Users watch and shop without leaving the stream, enhancing convenience. Influencers can demonstrate products in real-time, respond to questions, and close sales instantly — a highly effective format for impulse buying.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="con">
        <h3>🔐 Privacy & Overconsumption Risks</h3>
        <p>Algorithmic decisions may affect user satisfaction and data safety. There's a concern over privacy violations, overdependence on algorithmic decisions, and the potential for addictive behaviors due to continuous engagement.</p>
